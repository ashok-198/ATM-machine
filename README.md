# **ATM-machine & Back Office Operation**

my personal project is based on self-learning ( based on a 1.5-month learning duration )


## *Projects:*

1. ATM Machine
2. Back Office Operation

## *Description:*

These projects demonstrate my skills in Python programming, problem-solving, and data handling.

Run ATM_machine.py which is the ATM machine Simulation.

Run Back_Office_Operation.py which is a Simulation of the back office operation of an imaginary Banking Enterprise.

## *ATM Machine (Machine_operation.py):*

- Simulates an ATM machine using Python
- Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Handles user input and output
- Demonstrates error handling and debugging

## *Back Office Operation (Back_Office_Operation.py):*

- Provides back office access for administrative tasks
- Handles JSON data for storing and retrieving data
- Implements user input and output
- Demonstrates error handling and debugging

## **_Technologies Used_**:

- Python programming language
- JSON data handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

## *_How to Run:_*

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python scripts using a Python interpreter
